/**
 * Project directory resolution for standalone panels (Settings and Profile).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The sidebar KiloProvider always uses `getWorkspaceDirectory()`, which returns
 * `workspaceFolders[0]`. That works because the sidebar is tied to the window
 * and there's an implicit "current workspace" context.
 *
 * Standalone editor panels (opened via SettingsEditorProvider) don't have that
 * implicit context. In a **multi-root workspace** — where VS Code has multiple
 * folders open (e.g. `/repo-a` and `/repo-b`) — we can't just pick
 * `workspaceFolders[0]` because the active editor may belong to `/repo-b`,
 * not `/repo-a`.
 *
 * The resolution strategy is:
 *
 * 1. If the user has a file open in an editor, use that file's workspace folder.
 *    This is the strongest signal of which project they're working in.
 *
 * 2. If there's exactly one workspace folder, use it. There's no ambiguity.
 *
 * 3. If there are multiple folders and no active editor, return `null` to
 *    return `null`. This prevents silently selecting the wrong project.
 *
 * ## How KiloProvider uses this
 *
 * Each KiloProvider instance can receive an explicit `projectDirectory` via
 * `KiloProviderOptions`. When set:
 *
 * - A string value overrides the workspace directory for project-scoped operations
 * - `null` explicitly disables project scope (forces global-only)
 * - `undefined` (default, used by the sidebar) falls through to `getWorkspaceDirectory()`
